# LeetCode-DSA

This repository contains my personal solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++. The purpose of this collection is to strengthen data structures and algorithms (DSA) concepts, practice for interviews, and build a consistent problem-solving routine.

## Overview

Each solution is written with clarity and efficiency in mind. Alongside the implementation, you‚Äôll also find time and space complexity mentioned to provide deeper insight into performance trade-offs.

## Features

- Clean, modular, and readable C++ code
- Time and space complexity analysis for each problem
- Organized file naming that reflects the original problem title
- Broad coverage of core DSA topics, including:
  - Arrays & Strings
  - Hash Maps & Sets
  - Recursion & Backtracking
  - Linked Lists, Trees & Graphs
  - Sorting & Searching
  - Sliding Window, Two Pointers
  - Dynamic Programming and more

## File Naming Convention

Each file corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem and is named accordingly:

`productOfArrayExceptSelf.cpp` ‚Üí Solution to ‚ÄúProduct of Array Except Self‚Äù  
`mergeAlternatively.cpp` ‚Üí Solution to ‚ÄúMerge Strings Alternatively‚Äù... 


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A working C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- A text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, CLion, etc.)

### Running Solutions

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZahraYasin2209/LeetCode-DSA.git
   cd LeetCode-DSA

2. Compile and run any file:
   ```bash
   g++ twoSum.cpp -o twoSum
   ./twoSum

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome! If you have a different approach or an optimized solution to any problem, feel free to contribute.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
3. Add your solution with a proper filename and comments
4. Commit your changes
5. Open a pull request for review

Please ensure that each solution includes its **time and space complexity**.
