# LeetCode Solutions in C++

This repository is a curated collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++. The goal is to maintain a clean and optimized codebase for learning, practice, and technical interview preparation.

## About the Repository

This project serves as a personal notebook of algorithms and problem-solving strategies. Each solution is thoughtfully crafted with readability and performance in mind.

### Highlights

- **Structured & Readable**: Code is cleanly written with meaningful comments.
- **Optimized**: Wherever possible, solutions are optimized for both time and space complexity.
- **Wide Range of Topics**: Includes solutions across topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, hashmaps, and more.

### File Naming Convention

Each file is named after its corresponding problem on LeetCode. For example:

- `twoSum.cpp` → Solution to the "Two Sum" problem  
- `pivotIndex.cpp` → Solution to the "Find Pivot Index" problem

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the solutions locally, ensure you have:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- An IDE or editor like Visual Studio Code, CLion, or any of your choice
